take file input in main
send to file to graph class
if a node is initiator send the node to main class 
and other nodes 
create node classes from the node names 
start them in main
Node class uses the channel class to send message , send own name , adjacent vertexs name and the message
channel class have a concurrent hashmap where key must be a object<src,dest> and value is blocking queue representing the channel between src to dest.

randomly choose between message and marker , if message then randomly generate some message , if marker the no message after that.

for initiator,
before sending marker ,print sending queue , recieved queue and then send marker

for others,
after receiving marker, print sending queue , recieved queue and then send marker to adjacent nodes.

this cannot be synchronized ?
