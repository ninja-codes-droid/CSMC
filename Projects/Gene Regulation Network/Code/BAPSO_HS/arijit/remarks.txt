1. early convergence 
2. results are getting bad for higher iteration 
3. for lower iterations, output is not completely optimized
4. maybe 4000 is the correct iteration 
5. 0th gene shows the overfit nature, the final MSE graph or all over output is heavily impacted by that


#ideas
1. same inertia weight 
2. is this positive to stop specific genes iteration when overfits ?
        track all the fitness(except initial) values, if value is changes more a certain threshold, stop. (like knee finding)
